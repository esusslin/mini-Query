# mini-Query
Re-written javascript query library with vanilla JS

In this project I have created modular code in Javascript:

Implement css selector library in Javascript.
Implement DOM manipulation library in Javascript.
Implement event dispatch library in Javascript.
Implement http requests library in Javascript.
Understand and reimplement jQuery as a toolbelt that collects various libraries.

Release 0:

Create a module called SweetSelector that allows me to do the following:

select a dom element by id
select a dom element by class
select a dom element by tag name

--
Release 1: 

Create a module called DOM that allows me to do the following to elements on the DOM once selected:

hide elements
show elements
add a class
remove a class

--
Release 2: 

Create a module called EventDispatcher that allows me to set up event listeners and triggers on the DOM.

--
Release 3:

Create a module called AjaxWrapper that allows me to send XMLHttpRequests and define Promises for asynchronous computations.

--
Release 4:

Namespace all of our tools/libraries into one toolbelt called miniQuery which allows me to chain events together:

selection
DOM manipulation
event definition
event triggering
asynchronous XML requests

--
Release 5:

Create a callback function that can be executed when the DOM has loaded entirely

--
Release 6:

Wrap my money tool library in a fancy $ symbol so I can call my money tools with a money sign $$
